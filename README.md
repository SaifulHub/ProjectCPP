# ProjectCPP

This is a basic c++ project. I built it long ago, when I was just acquinted with programming. 
To be more precise, when I was at 3rd Semester in my bachelor study.
So, this project is just a DEMO-like project but can be helpful for C++ biginners.
Just download it, open with any code editor and run it. 
For learning, just observe how this project works.
Thank you.
